       The code for this site including the autograders, slides, and course content is all available on GitHub. That means you could make your own copy of the course site, publish it and remix it any way you like. Even more exciting, you could translate the entire site (course) into your own language and publish it. I have provided some instructions on how to translate this course in my GitHub repository.
